A frontend for the 2d.wave max object with some nice quality of life features aimed at jumbling up breakbeats.

Takes a sound file and cuts in into chunks. Chunks can be selected manually, sequenced with a random looping sequencer or moved between with LFOs or Lorenz style chaos. Its intended use is with a sound file containing numerous variations of the same loop (e.g. different effects applied) in order to create random variations of timbre on each beat. When used in this way ensure the sound file has no gaps at the start/end or between loops, otherwise sync issues will occur. The patch can also be used with any sound file for granular like effects.
